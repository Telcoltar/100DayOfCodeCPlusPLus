# 100 Days of Code C++ Crash Course Part
This is the repository of the C++ Part of my #100DaysOfCode. I'm following the
book C++ Crash Course: A Fast-Paced Introduction by Josh Lospinoso.

The code is organized by parts and chapters of the book. In der chapters I
have put some code which I wrote while working through the chapter and my
solutions to the exercises in the chapter.

### Day 1 (Chapter 1 and 2):
Chapter 1 is introduction and setup. Chapter 2 is built-in types and
user-defined types like enum class, struct and class.

### Day 2 (Chapter 3):
Today was mainly about pointers and references.

### Day 3 (Chapter 4):
Today I learned about object lifecycle, copy/move semantics and error handling.

### Day 4 (Chapter 5):
This chapter is about interfaces and injectors.

### Day 5 (Chapter 6):
In this chapter I learned about templates, concepts and a little 
about casting.

### Day 6 (Chapter 7):
I learned about operators and conversions.

### Day 7/8 (Chapter 8):
Learned several statements and expressions.

### Day 9/10 (Chapter 9)
This chapter was about function decorators, call-operator and 
lambda expressions.

### Day 11/12(Chapter 10)
This was about test and mockup Frameworks.
