# 100 Days of Code C++ Crash Course Part
This is the repository of the C++ Part of my #100DaysOfCode. I'm following the
book C++ Crash Course: A Fast-Paced Introduction by Josh Lospinoso.

The code is organized by parts and chapters of the book. In der chapters I
have put some code which I wrote while working through the chapter and my
solutions to the exercises in the chapter.

### Day 1 (Chapter 1 and 2):
Chapter 1 is introduction and setup. Chapter 2 is built-in types and
user-defined types like enum class, struct and class.

### Day 2 (Chapter 3):
Today was mainly about pointers and references.

### Day 3 (Chapter 4):
Today I learned about object lifecycle, copy/move semantics and error handling.

### Day 4 (Chapter 5):
This chapter is about interfaces and injectors.

### Day 5 (Chapter 6):
In this chapter I learned about templates, concepts and a little 
about casting.

### Day 6 (Chapter 7):
I learned about operators and conversions.

### Day 7/8 (Chapter 8):
Learned several statements and expressions.

### Day 9/10 (Chapter 9)
This chapter was about function decorators, call-operator and 
lambda expressions.

### Day 11/12 (Chapter 10)
This was about test and mockup Frameworks.

### Day 13 (Chapter 11/ Chapter 12)
Chapter 11 is about smart pointers. Chapter 12 covers utilities like
random number generators or optional.

### Day 14 (Chapter 13/ Chapter 14)
Chapter 14 covers all kinds of Container (arrays, vectors, ques,
(hash-)sets, (hash-)maps). 15 is a short chapter about iterators.

### Day 15 (Chapter 15)
This chapter was all about strings.

### Day 16 (Chapter 16)
All kinds of streams.

### Day 17 (Chapter 17)
All about path, files and directories.

### Day 18 (Chapter 18)
Massive amounts of algorithms.

### Day 19 (Chapter 19)
High level parallel programming with async tasks. Atomics and mutex to 
share objects 

### Day 20 (Chapter 20)
Network programming with boost asio library. Low level tcp and udp
connections and high level with boost beast.
