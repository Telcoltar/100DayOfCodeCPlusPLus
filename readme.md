# 100 Days of Code C++ Crash Course Part
This is the repository of the C++ Part of my #100DaysOfCode. I'm following the
book C++ Crash Course: A Fast-Paced Introduction by Josh Lospinoso.

The code is organized by parts and chapters of the book. In der chapters I
have put some code which I wrote while working through the chapter and my
solutions to the exercises in the chapter.

### Day 1 (Chapter 1 and 2):
Chapter 1 is introduction and setup. Chapter 2 is built-in types and
user-defined types like enum class, struct and class.
